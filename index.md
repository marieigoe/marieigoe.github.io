**Self-Assessment**



   
	
  I began my journey studying Computer Science in June of 2018. Prior to attending Southern New Hampshire University, I attended a local community college where I took some general education courses. Eventually, I was drawn to mathematics and technology. Throughout this program, I have learned many skills that I will use in my future career endeavors. I have practiced critical thinking and problem solving in each of my courses. I have learned various computer languages, analyzed code, received feedback on written code, presented various topics, outlined and studied important information, and much more. Some courses have been harder than others, but I have been able to work through and complete what was necessary to get to the finish line.
  
  I work in software support for an educational software company. The type of help a customer needs ranges from needing instructions for the general or basic functions of the software, to them reporting an error message or bug in the program. I work alongside the development team and report bugs and other issues that are fixed on the backend. My future plans are to work in software development. I think that with my background in school coupled with my experience working in software support, I will be able to learn the role as a developer and will be able to succeed in it.

  There are many ways to demonstrate computer and programming capabilities. The use of an ePortfolio can showcase a collection of work online. The collections of work will consist of pieces that demonstrate different skills and provide evidence of concepts learned through coursework. For the computer science capstone, I have included three artifacts falling into the following categories: Software engineering/design, algorithms and data structures, and databases.
The artifact for the software engineering/design category consists of a program written in C++ and is enhanced by being converted to Python. This will demonstrate my ability to logically take a program that is written in a computer language, understand the function and purpose, and convert it to another language. For the algorithms and data structures category, I have enhanced an artifact that is a pet services program. This program allows for the user to interact with the program. The use of this artifact in my portfolio is to demonstrate my ability to create a functioning program written in Java with several classes. The last category is for databases. The artifact is used to demonstrate my knowledge of NoSQL database, known as mongodb. I utilize the terminal on my computer after installing mongodb and preform various tasks beyond CRUD including inserting into a document, changing the access permissions to documents, and more.
