<p><strong>NARRATIVE:</strong></p>
<p>The second artifact represents the Algorithms and data structures category. It is a program from IT145 and it is a &ldquo;Pet Services&rdquo; program written in java. This program is used at a pet service facility. It allows a user to enter information about the visiting pet, such as the type of pet, name, and age of the pet. The facility offers grooming and boarding as services, so you can also enter in information about the pet&rsquo;s space, the number of days staying, and get the amount due for the owner. This example was chosen to represent this category as I was able to take the written program and expand the complexity, by adding an additional service, as well as improve the efficiency of the program.</p>
