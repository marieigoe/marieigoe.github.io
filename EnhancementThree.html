<h1><strong>Category: Database</strong></h1>
<h1><strong>Enhancement Three</strong></h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>NARRATIVE:</strong></h2>
<p>The artifact that was used for the third category in regards to databases is from course CS340 (Advanced Programming Concepts). This project was about implementing the CRUD operations in MongoDB. This artifact was included to demonstrate the ability to manipulate a NoSQL database. For the enhancement, I installed MongoDB onto my computer and performed tasks including finding and replacing a document, adding a user, updating user permissions, revoking permissions, and more. As shown in the screenshots, there were commands utilized after performing tasks such as the &ldquo;DB&rdquo; command. This was used before inserting documents to ensure they would be inserted into the correct DB or collection. I was able to meet the planned enhancements for this artifact. As I was working on this enhancement, I had a hard time getting access to the virtual environment in which I used for CS 340. I ended up installing it on my computer through the terminal. I did learn that I should have installed it on my computer, to begin with, and to avoid the delay. Regarding working with MongoDB, I did not run into any issues. I did have to use online resources such as Stack Overflow as I had issues installing it on my Mac. Overall, this artifact was a great refresher to working with and manipulating a NoSQL database.</p>
